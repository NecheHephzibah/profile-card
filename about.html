      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always been drawn to how technology can make life simpler, and how design can make it beautiful. 
        My journey into web development started with curiosity. I had that desire to not just use digital tools, 
        but to create them. Every new concept I learn feels like unlocking a small piece of magic, and each 
        project teaches me something new about how creativity and logic can coexist.

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest goal is to become a professional developer, one who writes clean, efficient, 
        and meaningful code. I want to build products that make people’s lives better and grow 
        into a developer who’s both technically skilled and creatively confident. 
        I hope to get to that point where I create that solution that resonates with majority of the world's population.

      <h2>Areas I’m Working On</h2>
      <p>
        I sometimes doubt how quickly I’m improving compared to others. 
        There are moments I hesitate before taking on challenging projects, 
        I worry that I might not get everything right the first time. 
        But I’ve learned that confidence grows with  a lot of practice and I’m definitely learning to trust the process more.

        Ah... Hephzibah, just keep going. Remember how far you’ve come, and how much you’ve learned through every mistake and late night. 
        You started from scratch, and you made something out of it. 
        Never lose the hunger to learn cause that’ll definitely take you to the top.

      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        For every successful person out there, in as much as perseverance played a major role, someone believed in them at certain times
        of their journey. There's no self made success. So, always remember to be that someone for others, and remember that one who believed in you.
