      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always been drawn to how technology can make life simpler, and how design can make it beautiful. 
        My journey into web development started with curiosity — the desire to not just use digital tools, 
        but to create them. Every new concept I learn feels like unlocking a small piece of magic, and each 
        project teaches me something new about how creativity and logic can coexist.

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest goal is to become a professional developer — one who writes clean, efficient, 
        and meaningful code. I want to build products that make people’s lives better and grow 
        into a developer who’s both technically skilled and creatively confident. 
        I hope to keep pushing myself until I can look back and say, “I built something that mattered.”

      <h2>Areas I’m Working On</h2>
      <p>
        I sometimes doubt how quickly I’m improving compared to others. 
        There are moments I hesitate before taking on challenging projects, 
        worried that I might not get everything right the first time. 
        But I’ve learned that confidence grows with practice — and I’m learning to trust the process more each day.

      <h2>A Note to My Future Self</h2>
      <p>
        Keep going. Remember how far you’ve come, and how much you’ve learned through every mistake and late night. 
        You started from scratch, and you made something out of it. 
        Never lose the hunger to learn — that’s what makes you unstoppable.

    <section data-testid="test-about-extra" class="about-section">
      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I think growth is about consistency — showing up even when it’s not easy, 
        and creating even when it’s not perfect. Every bug fixed, every line of code written, 
        and every new skill learned adds up. And that’s something to be proud of.
